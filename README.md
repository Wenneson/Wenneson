# 👋 Hey, I'm Michael Wenneson

🚀 I'm a network engineer turned automation architect, with a passion for clean Python, efficient DevOps, and infrastructure that scales.

🧰 Tools of my trade:
- Python, Ansible, Terraform
- Cisco | Meraki | VMware | ESXi | FTD
- GitHub Actions, CI/CD, and SD-WAN at scale

🧠 Currently working on:
- Automating Cisco-to-Meraki migrations via API
- A dashboard for config diffing & lifecycle management

🎯 My mission: *Make networking as automated, repeatable, and elegant as software dev.*
